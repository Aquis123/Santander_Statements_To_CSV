Overview

An overdraft occurs when you do not have enough money in your account to cover a transaction, but we pay it anyway. We can cover your
overdrafts in two different ways: 
1.       We have standard overdraft practices that come with your account.
2.       We also offer an overdraft protection plan, which allows you to link other deposit accounts, such as a savings account, to cover
overdrafts in your checking account. This plan may be less expensive than our standard overdraft practices. To learn more, ask us
about this plan.
This notice explains our standard overdraft practices.

What are the standard overdraft practices that come with my account?
We do authorize and pay overdrafts for the following types of transactions:

    Checks and other transactions made using your checking account number                Recurring Debit Card transactions

    Automatic bill payments                                                                                               Online Banking payments and transfers

We do not authorize and pay overdrafts for the following types of transactions unless you ask us to (see below):

    ATM transactions 

    One-time Debit Card purchases


We pay overdrafts at our discretion, which means we do not guarantee that we will always authorize and pay any type of
transaction. If we do not authorize and pay an overdraft, your transaction will be declined.

What fees will I be charged if Santander pays an overdraft?
Under our standard overdraft practices: 

        We will charge you a fee of up to $35 each time we pay an overdraft (maximum of six (6) per Business Day), and
        An additional one-time fee of $35 will be charged on the sixth (6th) Business Day after your account has been overdrawn for five (5)
consecutive Business Days. This charge generally applies to checking, savings, and money market savings accounts. See the Fee
Schedule for details.

What if I want Santander to authorize and pay overdrafts on my ATM and one-time Debit Card transactions? 
If you want us to authorize and pay overdrafts on ATM and one-time Debit Card transactions, visit a Santander branch or call our Customer
Service Center at 877-768-2265.

Can I change my mind later?
If you tell us that we are permitted to pay any overdrafts caused by ATM or one-time debit transactions, you can always change your mind and
tell us you no longer want us to do this. 

You can visit any Santander branch or call us at 877-768-2265 to tell us you no longer want us to pay these types of overdrafts.
